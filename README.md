# ITD Animator

This function allows the user to visualize the working operation of the local maxima finder tree detection algorithm by creating a beautiful GIF of the process.

The function works by taking an input CHM, performing local maxima tree detection with lidR [locate_trees](https://rdrr.io/cran/lidR/man/locate_trees.html "lidR info page on locate_trees"), and subsequently plotting the moving window as it proceeds through the CHM cells.

This work is based on the demonstration by [ptompalski](https://github.com/ptompalski) his original code can be viewed [here](https://gist.github.com/ptompalski/94904eca2e1628fb52010c2890431715).
